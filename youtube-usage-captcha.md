If you find that you are logged into a YouTube account but your Musi app still will not play videos, make sure that videos are playable within the "YouTube Login" area in Musi. From time to time, YouTube may require you to enter a captcha in order to continue playing videos.

1. Tap More > YouTube Login.

2\. Open any video in the YouTube mobile website and play the video. Ensure that the video plays and opens when you play it.

3\. Return to the Musi app and try playing a video. You should typically find that video playback now works within Musi.

**Check your internet connection**

If you are logged into Musi, have verified that videos play on the YouTube mobile website, but you are still unable to play videos within Musi, you may need to change your internet connection.

From time to time, YouTube will block certain public networks from being able to play videos on Musi. These include public WiFi networks like cafes and coffee shops, or even shared cellular networks like mobile networks. Ensuring that you play videos on a private WiFi network will ensure the app functions properly.
